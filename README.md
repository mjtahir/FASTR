# FASTR
Project Fixed-wing Autonomous System Transition Race (FASTR) involves an autonomous fixed-wing drone racing through a circuit. The work presented in this repository is a step towards building autonomy into drones. An off-the-shelf 'Tello' quadrotor was used for testing utilising its provided SDK commands, computer vision algorithms to detect gates, external localisation using OptiTrack, and many PID controllers for navigation.
